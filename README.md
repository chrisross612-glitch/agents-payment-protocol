# Agent Payments Protocol (APP)

Goal: Extend agent-to-agent communication (A2A) with tokenized micropayments.

- **Problem:** Agents today can exchange tasks, but lack a universal way to exchange value.
- **Solution:** Attach payment metadata (price, wallet, tx hash) to agent task messages.
- **Outcome:** Enables open marketplaces of autonomous agents where services can be bought/sold seamlessly.

## Roadmap
- Phase 1: Documentation + Wallet setup
- Phase 2: Testnet transaction prototype
- Phase 3: Demo agent-to-agent paid interaction
